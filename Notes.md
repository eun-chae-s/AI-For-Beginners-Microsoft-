## Introduction to AI

1. Who invented proto-computers in 19th century?
	1. Charles Babbage invented computers to **operate numbers following an algorithm**
2. What is the difference between **Weak AI and Strong AI**?
	1. **Weak Ai** is AI designed for a **small specific task** or **a narrow set of tasks**
		1. they do not have great understanding of consciousness, i.e. do not have human-like cognitive abilities.
		2. examples
			3. Siri, Alexa, chatbots
	2. **Strong AI** is AI with human-level intelligence and understanding
		1. they can perform some complicated tasks that humans can do, adapt to different domains and new knowledge, and have a form of consciousness
		2. it is also a long-term goal of AI research and the current industry tries to develop AI that can **reason, learn, understand, and adapt to a wide range**
3. What is the **definition of intelligence**?
	1. it depends on how people think about the term
4. What is **Turing Test**?
	1. It is a test which compares between a system and human being. If a human interrogator cannot distinguish between these two based on text-based dialogue, then this system is considered to be intelligent.
5. What are some approaches to make computer behave like a human?
	1. these approaches are based on how our own processes of making decisions work
	2. **Top-down Approach (Symbolic Reasoning)**
		1. extract knowledge from a human and represent that knowledge in a computer-readable form
		2. like how doctors diagnose patients (applying a large set of rules)
		3. however, this approach does not have that great scalability
			1. complicated to extract & apply human knowledge
			2. too expensive
	3. **Bottom-up Approach (Neural Networks)**
		1. model the structure of human brain, where each neuron acts like a weighted average of its inputs
		2. then train a network of neurons to solve useful problems by providing **training data**
		3. a.k.a **Machine Learning**
	4. **Multi-agent Approach**
	5. **Evolutionary Approach**
6. When did AI start?
	1. during the mid 20th century
